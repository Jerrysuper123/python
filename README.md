# python

If the package is **not on PyPI** and is just some local file or folder, you can still use it â€” you just need to know whether itâ€™s a **source distribution**, a **wheel**, or just **plain Python code**.

---

## **1. If itâ€™s a `.whl` file**

```bash
pip install /path/to/package_file.whl
```

---

## **2. If itâ€™s a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` source distribution**

```bash
pip install /path/to/package_file.tar.gz
```

or:

```bash
pip install /path/to/package_file.zip
```

---

## **3. If itâ€™s a folder with `setup.py`**

You can install it locally:

```bash
pip install /path/to/package_folder
```

or in editable mode (good for development):

```bash
pip install -e /path/to/package_folder
```

---

## **4. If itâ€™s just plain `.py` files (no setup.py)**

You donâ€™t even have to install â€” just add the path to `sys.path`:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/path/to/folder")
import mymodule  # from /path/to/folder/mymodule.py
```

---

ðŸ’¡ If you want to **bundle** a local package file inside your project so it works without any installation step, you can just drop it in your project folder and import it directly.

The `$PATH` environment variable is a **colon-separated list** of directories that your shell searches to find executables. When you run a command (like `python`, `git`, or `ls`), the shell looks through each directory listed in `$PATH` to find the corresponding executable file.

### 1. **Basic Construction of `$PATH`**

Your `$PATH` is built up from the following sources:

* **System default directories**: These are usually set by the operating system. On macOS or Linux, common directories are `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin`.
* **User-defined directories**: These directories can be added by you or by software installers like Homebrew, Pyenv, etc.

### 2. **How `$PATH` is Set**

* **Temporary**: You can set `$PATH` temporarily within a terminal session using:

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory
  ```

  This adds `/new/directory` to the existing `$PATH`.

* **Permanent**: To make changes persistent, you need to add them to your shell configuration files, such as:

  * `~/.bash_profile` (for bash)
  * `~/.zshrc` (for zsh)
  * `~/.bashrc` (for bash on Linux)

  Example to add a directory permanently:

  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory
  ```

  Then, reload the config file:

  ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

### 3. **Example `$PATH` Construction on macOS/Linux**

Hereâ€™s an example of what `$PATH` might look like on macOS:

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin
```

### **Explanation of Directories in `$PATH`**:

1. **`/usr/local/bin`**: This directory often contains executables installed by the user (e.g., Homebrew packages).
2. **`/usr/bin`**: The default directory for system-wide executables.
3. **`/bin`**: Contains essential command binaries.
4. **`/usr/sbin`**: Contains system administration binaries.
5. **`/opt/homebrew/bin`**: If using Homebrew on macOS, this directory stores Homebrew-installed executables.

When you run a command like `python`, the shell checks each directory in this list from left to right to find the corresponding executable.

### 4. **How \$PATH Affects Which Python Version Is Used**

The order in which directories are listed in `$PATH` determines which version of Python is used. If you have multiple versions installed, the shell will use the first one it finds.

For example:

* If `$PATH` is `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`, and `python` is symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/python3.9`, the shell will use Python 3.9.
* But if `python` is symlinked to `/usr/bin/python3.13`, then Python 3.13 will be used, as `/usr/bin` comes before `/usr/local/bin`.

### 5. **Checking `$PATH`**

To see how `$PATH` is constructed, you can print it in the terminal:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

### 6. **Modifying `$PATH`**

If you need to change `$PATH`, you can either add a new directory to the beginning or end. For example, to prioritize a specific Python version:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/python/bin:$PATH
```

This puts `/path/to/python/bin` at the **front** of your `$PATH`, meaning the shell will use the Python in this directory first.

---

### **Summary:**

* `$PATH` is a list of directories the shell searches for executables.
* The order of directories in `$PATH` determines which version of a command is used when there are multiple versions installed.
* You can modify `$PATH` temporarily (for the session) or permanently (via shell configuration files).

Would you like help adjusting your `$PATH` or investigating why a specific version of Python is being used?

When you run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

The version of Python that gets used for the virtual environment (`.venv`) is determined by **the `python` executable in your `$PATH`** at the time you run the command.

Here's how Python "knows" which version to use:

---

### 1. **The Python Executable (`python`) in Your `$PATH`**

When you run `python -m venv .venv`, it invokes the **`python` executable** that is in your systemâ€™s **`$PATH`**.

The `$PATH` is a list of directories that your shell searches to find executable files. The order of these directories matters.

For example, when you run `python` or `python3`, the shell looks for it in the directories listed in `$PATH` and uses the first one it finds.

#### Example:

* If you have `python3.9` installed at `/usr/local/bin/python3.9` and `python3` installed at `/usr/bin/python3`, then running `python` might invoke `python3` from `/usr/bin` if that's the first match in your `$PATH`.

---

### 2. **How Python Chooses the Version**

When you run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

* **If `python` is mapped to `python3.13`** (from your `$PATH`), it will use Python 3.13 to create the virtual environment.
* **If `python` is mapped to `python3.9`**, it will use Python 3.9 to create the virtual environment.

### Example of `$PATH` Impact:

If you run `which python`, you might get something like:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13
```

This means Python 3.13 from `/opt/homebrew/bin/` will be used by `python -m venv`.

If you want to make sure that a specific version of Python is used, you can run:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .venv
```

This will create the virtual environment using **Python 3.9** explicitly, regardless of what the default `python` points to.

---

### 3. **Using a Specific Python Version in Virtualenv**

If you want to use a specific Python version for the virtual environment, you can specify that version directly in the command, like:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .venv
```

This will use Python 3.9 even if your default `python` points to another version (e.g., 3.13).

### 4. **Inspecting the Virtualenv**

Once you've created the virtual environment, you can check which Python version itâ€™s using by activating the virtual environment and running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python --version
```

This will show the version of Python used in the virtual environment.

---

### Summary:

* The `python -m venv .venv` command uses whichever `python` executable is in your `$PATH`.
* You can specify the exact version of Python to use, like `python3.9 -m venv .venv`, to control which version is used.

To check how many versions of Python you have installed on your system, you can use these commands:

### âœ… 1. **List Python Versions in `/usr/local/bin` (or `/opt/homebrew/bin`)**

```bash
ls /usr/local/bin/python*
```

or if you're using Homebrew:

```bash
ls /opt/homebrew/bin/python*
```

This will list all versions of Python installed in these directories, like:

```
/usr/local/bin/python3
/usr/local/bin/python3.9
/usr/local/bin/python3.10
```

---

### âœ… 2. **List All Installed Versions Using `pyenv` (if using `pyenv`)**

If youâ€™re using `pyenv` to manage multiple versions of Python:

```bash
pyenv versions
```

This will show all the Python versions `pyenv` is managing, like:

```
  system
  3.7.9
  3.9.6
  3.10.0
```

---

### âœ… 3. **Check All Installed Versions with `which`**

You can also use the `which` command to check the specific locations of Python versions:

```bash
which -a python python3 python3.9 python3.10
```

This will list the paths for each version, if they exist:

```
/usr/local/bin/python3.9
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10
/usr/bin/python3
```

---

### âœ… 4. **Check Installed Versions Using Homebrew (if installed via Homebrew)**

```bash
brew list | grep python
```

This will show the versions of Python installed via Homebrew, like:

```
python@3.9
python@3.10
```

---

### âœ… 5. **Check Installed Versions via `pkgutil` (macOS-specific)**

```bash
pkgutil --pkgs | grep python
```

This shows the Python packages installed via macOS system utilities.

---

### Conclusion:

These commands should give you a clear view of the Python versions installed on your system, whether through system-wide installations, Homebrew, or version management tools like `pyenv`.

Would you like to explore any of these methods further?



You're encountering this error because **Voila or Jupyter is running with a Python kernel that isn't pointing to your `.venv`**, even though you've activated the environment in your terminal. Thatâ€™s why it canâ€™t find `pandas`.

### ðŸ”¥ Key Clues from the Logs:

* Python version shown: **3.9.6**
* Your virtualenv is using **Python 3.13**

  ```
  /.../.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/...
  ```
* This mismatch means: **Voila is launching a different kernel than your `.venv`**, and `pandas` isn't installed there.

---

### âœ… Fix: Force Jupyter/Voila to Use Your `.venv` Kernel

#### 1. **Activate Your Environment in Terminal**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. **Install `ipykernel` and Register Your Kernel**

Run this *inside the activated environment*:

```bash
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name user-behaviour-env --display-name "Python (user-behaviour)"
```

This registers your `.venv` environment with Jupyter.

#### 3. **Install Voila Inside the Virtual Environment**

To avoid version mismatches, do:

```bash
pip install voila
```

Then start Voila **from within the environment**:

```bash
voila your_notebook.ipynb
```

This ensures Voila uses the correct Python interpreter.

#### 4. **(Optional) Remove Broken Kernel**

You may have old/broken Jupyter kernels. List them:

```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

Remove any outdated ones (e.g., `python3`):

//we might have uninstall the old kernel to resolve the issue

```bash
jupyter kernelspec uninstall old-kernel-name
```

Replace `old-kernel-name` with the actual name you want to remove.

---

### âœ… Final Check

After all this, running:

```bash
which python
```

Should show:

```
/your/project/.venv/bin/python
```

And in the notebook interface, the kernel you use should be named:

```
Python (user-behaviour)
```

---



The relationship between **kernel**, **Python environment**, and **underlying libraries** is central to how a Jupyter Notebook or Python script runs. Here's a breakdown of how they interconnect:

### 1. **Kernel**

* A **kernel** is the computational engine that runs your code.
* In Jupyter Notebooks, the kernel executes the Python code in each cell and returns the result.
* Each kernel is tied to a specific **Python interpreter** (such as one from a virtual environment, system Python, or conda environment).
* When you change the kernel in Jupyter or VS Code, you're telling it which **Python environment** it should use to run the code.

### 2. **Python Environment**

* A **Python environment** refers to a specific **Python interpreter** along with its installed packages. This can be:

  * **System-wide Python** (default Python installed on your OS).
  * **Virtual Environments** (`.venv`, `venv`, `conda`, etc.), where you isolate specific packages for a project.
  * **Conda environments** (`conda create`), where you create and manage isolated environments with specific Python versions and dependencies.
* The **Python environment** ensures that your project uses the exact dependencies (such as `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.) you need for the project to run correctly.

### 3. **Underlying Libraries**

* The **underlying libraries** (such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, etc.) are the **packages** installed within the **Python environment**.
* Libraries are installed via package managers like `pip` (e.g., `pip install pandas`) or `conda` (for Conda environments).
* The **kernel** communicates with the **Python environment** to access these libraries and execute the code that uses them.

---

### âœ… How They Work Together:

1. **Python Environment**:

   * You create a virtual environment for your project (e.g., `.venv`) to ensure that you have the exact packages you need for that specific project.
   * This environment contains a **specific version of Python** and any libraries you install, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, or `matplotlib`.

2. **Kernel**:

   * You select the **kernel** that is linked to your Python environment. The kernel uses the Python interpreter from that environment to execute the code.
   * If you select a kernel tied to a `.venv` or conda environment, it will use the exact Python interpreter and packages from that environment to run your code.

3. **Libraries**:

   * The libraries you install (e.g., `pandas`) are available for use in that Python environment.
   * If you're running code in a notebook, the kernel will use the packages installed in the environment to execute the notebook's code.

### Example Flow:

* You create a virtual environment (e.g., `.venv`) for your project.
* You install `pandas` and other libraries in that `.venv`.
* When you open a Jupyter notebook, you select the kernel corresponding to that `.venv` environment.
* The kernel executes the code and accesses the libraries installed in that `.venv`.

### Summary:

* **Kernel** is the engine that runs your code.
* **Python Environment** provides the interpreter and libraries.
* **Libraries** are the packages installed within the environment that your code uses.

When there's a **mismatch** between the kernel and the Python environment, or if the kernel canâ€™t find the libraries installed in the current environment, you'll encounter errors like `ModuleNotFoundError`.

# Standard Output (stdout)

In computing, stdout stands for Standard Output. It refers to the default output stream where a program writes its output data. When a program executes, it can produce output in various forms, such as text, images, or audio. Stdout is one of the three standard streams in Unix-like operating systems, along with stdin (Standard Input) and stderr (Standard Error).

How stdout works

When a program runs, it inherits three file descriptors:

0: stdin (input)
1: stdout (output)
2: stderr (error)
By default, stdout is connected to the terminal or console where the program is running. Any output written by the program to stdout is displayed on the screen.

Examples of stdout

A simple echo command in a shell script: echo "Hello World!" outputs "Hello World!" to stdout.
A Python program that uses print(): print("Hello World!") outputs "Hello World!" to stdout.
A Java program that uses System.out.println(): System.out.println("Hello World!"); outputs "Hello World!" to stdout.
Redirecting stdout

Output can be redirected from stdout to a file or another device using redirection operators (>, >>, etc.). For example:

echo "Hello World!" > output.txt redirects the output to a file named output.txt.
echo "Hello World!" >> output.txt appends the output to the end of the existing file output.txt.
In summary, stdout is the primary output stream where programs write their output data, which is usually displayed on the screen or redirected to a file or other device.
